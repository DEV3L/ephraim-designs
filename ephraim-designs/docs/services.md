## Art That Stirs Souls (and Maybe Raises Eyebrows)

At **Ephraim Designs**, we’re not just painting pretty pictures. We’re crafting bold, faith-rooted art with a touch of sass and a lot of heart. Whether it’s a mural that whispers scripture or a live painting that winks at you mid-stroke, our services are about creating connections, inspiring reflection, and maybe making you do a double take.

## What We Offer

### **Custom Murals**

Turn your walls into a conversation piece (or confession booth—your call). Our murals blend bold creativity with themes that range from the sacred to the slightly scandalous. Perfect for churches, businesses, or anyone who wants a splash of holy magic with a side of personality.

**What to Expect:**

- Designs tailored to your vision.
- Vibrant colors and intricate details that captivate.
- The occasional Easter egg (yes, that’s a cheeky dove winking at you).

**Popular Themes:**

- Faith and spirituality.
- Community storytelling.
- Playful pop culture (we’re looking at you, Jedi cat lovers).

### **Canvas Art**

Want something bold to hang in your home or office? We’ve got you covered. From soul-stirring abstracts to commissions so personal they’ll make your grandma blush, Jason’s canvas art tells stories in every brushstroke. Prints? Originals? Both? Yes, please.

**Perfect For:**

- Homes, offices, and worship spaces.
- Gifts for your artsy, faith-loving friend (or yourself).
- That one wall you’ve been pretending doesn’t exist.

**The Vibes:**

- Bold and unapologetic.
- Textures so layered they’re basically preaching.
- Maybe a hint of mischief—because why not?

### **Live Painting Events**

Watch the magic happen in real time. Jason’s live painting events are part performance, part creative chaos, and entirely unforgettable. Whether it’s a worship service, a festival, or your cousin’s wedding, these sessions are as interactive as they are inspiring.

**You’ll Get:**

- A front-row seat to creativity in action.
- A finished piece that’s auction-worthy—or Instagram gold.
- A few raised eyebrows when Jason sneaks in a playful detail or two.

**Best For:**

- Church services and conferences.
- Community events and fundraisers.
- Weddings, but only if you’re cool with an artist stealing the spotlight.

### **Workshops and Classes**

Think you can’t paint? Think again. Jason’s workshops turn skeptics into believers (and believers into budding artists). It’s a little faith, a lot of fun, and maybe a smidge of wine if you’re feeling brave.

**What’s On the Menu:**

- Abstract techniques you didn’t know you needed.
- Faith-inspired themes with plenty of room for personal interpretation.
- Team mural sessions that might just save your next corporate retreat.

**Who Should Join:**

- Aspiring artists and doodlers alike.
- Youth groups, church ministries, or your rowdy book club.
- Anyone who needs a creative reset—and a laugh.
